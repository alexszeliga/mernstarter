#### A MERN stack starter by Alex Szeliga

This project is a MERN stack starter repo. It is designed to live in a middle ground between aggressively modularized and specific project starters, and malformed anemic ones.

### MVC Structure

This starter uses an MVC structure which is ready to build out.

### Models

Models are handled with Mongoose.

### Views

The view engine is React, created via create-react-app

### Controller

Eyyyyy...Mongoose does that too!
